# SCT_DS_01

# Data Distribution Visualization
This project focuses on creating visual representations of data distributions using bar charts and histograms. These visualizations help to understand patterns and trends within categorical and continuous variables, such as gender or age distributions.

# Project Overview
The main aim of this project is to:

Visualize Categorical Data: Use bar charts to display frequency distributions of categories.
Visualize Continuous Data: Use histograms to represent the spread of numerical data.
Enhance data analysis and storytelling using effective visualizations.
Prerequisites
Ensure that the following are installed before proceeding:

Python: Version 3.8 or higher.
Libraries:
matplotlib
seaborn
pandas
numpy
Install required libraries using:

bash
Copy code
pip install matplotlib seaborn pandas numpy

# Project Steps
1. Dataset Preparation
Input Data: The dataset should include:
Categorical Variable Example: Gender, region, or occupation.
Continuous Variable Example: Age, salary, or height.
Example:
For categorical data: A table showing gender counts in a population.
For continuous data: A list of ages in a population sample.
2. Visualization Process
a) Bar Chart (Categorical Data)
Purpose: Show frequency or count of different categories.
Tool: matplotlib or seaborn.
b) Histogram (Continuous Data)
Purpose: Show the distribution of numerical data across ranges (bins).
Tool: matplotlib.
3. Chart Customization
Add titles, axis labels, and legends.
Use themes and color palettes for clarity.
Example Implementation
Bar Chart: Gender Distribution



# Expected Results
A bar chart showcasing the frequency of categories (e.g., gender breakdown).
A histogram displaying the distribution of continuous data (e.g., age spread).

# Additional Notes
Data Accuracy: Use real or realistic data to ensure meaningful insights.
Interactivity: For advanced projects, integrate interactive tools like Plotly or Dash.
